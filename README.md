# Frontend Coding Test

Contained within are secrets from another world! Just kidding, they're just my coding answers for the Riot Games Web Development Internship 2014 process.

## Getting Started

Start at index.html! I've commented on each exersize on it's own .html file, so be sure to read to get insight into my implementation and what my next steps might be.

##Notes

This was done using Chrome for OS X. In a real life scenario, I would have cross tested against all browsers possible.
