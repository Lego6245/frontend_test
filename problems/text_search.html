	<h1><span class="red">Text</span> Search</h1>
	<p>
		There are two main components below, a search form and a text article about turtles. The form should be setup such that a word or phase can be entered in the search form, and the number of occurences of that phrase is shown below. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, in the below text there are two occurences of the word "Testudines" so if you put that word in the search form, and submit, the results should say:

		<i>Found 2 occurances of the word "Testudines" in the below text.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that words can be contained within multiple levels of HTML elements, and phrases may cross those HTML element boundaries.
	</p>

	<h2> My Solution </h2>

	<p>
		Using javascript's textContent attribute, I was able to pull just the component text from the search area below. A simple binding of an onSubmit listener and the text was searchable! Not much more to it. Oh, it also has instant search. Just type and go! No need to submit :)
	</p>

	<h2> Next Steps </h2>

	<p>
		One thing I would have loved to try to do would be to do to highlight the found text. The case of hilighting found text, Is actually a very difficult problem to solve, at least in my experience. There's also two small quirks: It doesn't search across line breaks (mostly intentional, as it's normal behavor for search) and it will search through the citations (anything between brackets right now). Both behaviors are changed by modifying the regex currently used to clean up the textContent of citations. This would be something to discuss with whomever is asking for this implementation!

			Like all other extant reptiles, turtles are <a href="/wiki/Ectotherm" title="Ectotherm">ectotherms</a> their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called <a href="/wiki/Poikilotherm" title="Poikilotherm">cold-blooded</a>. However, because of their high metabolic rate, <a href="/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle" title="Leatherback sea turtle">leatherback sea turtles</a> have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.

			Like other <a href="/wiki/Amniote" title="Amniote">amniotes</a> (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals), they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water. The largest turtles are aquatic.
